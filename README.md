## Challenges Faced

### Incorporating Uni-directional Friendships

I faced the challenge of incorporating friendships in a way that they count for both users involved. This was solved by filtering through friendships using a selector function that returns friends of a given user. This works regardless of whether the given user corresponds to the "friend_id" or the "user_id" column of the friendships table. Differentiating between "accepted", "pending", and "deleted" friendships was critical to returning the correct content from the backend to mimic the behavior of Facebook.

<pre> 
```javascript
export const getFriendsByUserId = (userId) => (state) => {
    if (!userId) return [];

    const friendships = getFriendships(state).filter(friendship => 
        friendship.status === 'accepted' && (friendship.userId === userId || friendship.friendId === userId));
    const friends = friendships.map(friendship => {
        const user1 = state.users[friendship.userId] || state.session.user;
        user1.friendshipId = friendship.id;
        const user2 = state.users[friendship.friendId] || state.session.user;
        user2.friendshipId = friendship.id;
        return user1.id === userId ? user2 : user1;
    })
    return friends;
}
```
</pre>

### Slow Load Times

Another challenge was dealing with slow load times. This was mitigated by limiting the content that is stored in state to only things that are relevant to the logged-in user. Additionally, the amount of rendered content returned from the API backend was limited.

<pre>
```ruby
def index
    @post = Post.find(params[:post_id])
    
    if @post
        if params[:limited]
            @comments = @post.comments.includes(:commenter).order("comments.created_at DESC").limit(3)
        else 
            @comments = @post.comments.includes(:commenter).order("comments.created_at DESC")
        end 

        render 'api/comments/index'
    else 
        render json: @post.errors.full_messages, status: 404
    end
end
```
</pre>
